# Tutorial

## Case 1: Use Pre-trained Pipeline as a Whole

After installing [ü§ñÔ∏è RecBOT](./index), we quickly load pre-trained a Converstional Recommender Bot as follows:

```python
import recbot
model = recbot.Pipeline.from_pretrained('ReDIAL')
model("Recommend me some popular movies")
```

We input the conversation history and get the results from the pre-trained [ReDIAL](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2018/file/800de15c79c8d840f4e78d3af937d4d4-Paper.pdf) pipeline.

```bash
'The Shawshank Redemption (1994) \n
 The Godfather (1972) \n 
 The Dark Knight (2008) \n 
 The Godfather: Part II (1974) \n 
 The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003)'
```


## Case 2: Use Finer-Grained Pre-trained Components

We also provide finer-grained control on different components of a Converstional Recommender Bot as follows. 
We also explain the details of different components [here](./zoo/overview).

```python
import recbot
import recbot import AutoModel

model = recbot.Pipeline(
    processor = recbot.AutoModel.from_pretrained(HRNNForClassification"),
    manager = recbot.AutoModel.from_pretrained("RedialManager"),
    recommender = recbot.AutoModel.from_pretrained("AutoRec"),
    generator = recbot.AutoModel.from_pretrained("SwitchingDecoder"),
    aggregator = None,
)
```

We input the conversation history and get the results from the pre-trained [ReDIAL](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2018/file/800de15c79c8d840f4e78d3af937d4d4-Paper.pdf) pipeline.

```bash
'The Shawshank Redemption (1994) \n
 The Godfather (1972) \n 
 The Dark Knight (2008) \n 
 The Godfather: Part II (1974) \n 
 The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003)'
```
